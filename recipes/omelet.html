    <h3>Why ham and cheese tortillas?</h3>
    <p>A change of pace from a French omelet, the Denver omelet is known for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods I've ever learned to cook professionally, as a line cook in high school. Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 3 large eggs</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon butter </li>
        <li> ¼ cup diced smoked ham </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper </li>
        <li> salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li> ⅓ cup shredded Cheddar cheese </li>
        <li> 1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>
    </ul><br>

    <h3>Steps to make the perfect ham and cheese <i>tortillas</i></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs until just combined; do not over-beat.</li><br>

        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper. Sprinkle in a nice pinch of salt and a touch of pepper. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until onions start to soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in the eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along the edges of the omelet.</li><br>
        <li>Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over the omelet. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Fold omelet in half with your spatula and transfer to a plate.</li><br>
